# Hugo-Boss-Clone

This is the Homage piece set out by the Jump bootcamp. The challenge was to replicate the homepage of a site of our choosing. I chose the [Hugo Boss](https://www.hugoboss.com/uk/home) site and decided to use as little javascript as possible.

I used Sass and where required vanilla JS.

## To do

- [x] Create all elements
- [x] Create mobile nav and add transitions.
- [x] Style rest of content mobile first
- [x] Begin adding in breakpoints and style relevent elements
- [ ] Unpack header nav for large viewports.
